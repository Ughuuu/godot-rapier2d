A [rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier) physics server for [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), implemented as a GDExtension.

# [Limitations/Known Issues](https://github.com/fabriceci/godot-rapier2d/issues/8)

- One way direction not implemented
- WIP (still needs to be updated with what else needs to be done)

# Installation

- Automatic (WIP)

- Manual: 

  a. Download the github release and move only the `addons` folder into your project `addons` folder. After installing, go to `Advanced Settings` -> `Physics` -> `2D`. Change `Physics Engine` to `Rapier2D`.

  b. Build it yourself. Read more about it in the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.MD).

## Use the Rapier 2D extension

Copy the `addons/` folder to your project root.
